# Day 20: Snake Game (Part 1)

## Objectives
- Build the classic **Snake Game** using Turtle Graphics.
- Apply **Object Oriented Programming** concepts.
- Create a `Snake` class to manage snake segments and movement.
- Implement keyboard controls for directional movement.

## How it Works
- Snake starts with 3 segments.
- Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control direction.
- Snake moves continuously and turns based on user input.
- Screen updates at fixed intervals for smooth animation.

## How to Run
```bash
cd snake-game-part-1
python main.py
```

**Note**: This is Part 1 - basic movement. Food and collision detection come in Day 21!
