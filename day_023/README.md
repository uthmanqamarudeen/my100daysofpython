# Day 23: Turtle Crossing Game

## Objectives
- Build a **Turtle Crossing** game (like Frogger).
- Apply **OOP** with multiple classes (Player, CarManager, Scoreboard).
- Implement collision detection and level progression.
- Manage game state and difficulty scaling.

## How it Works
- **Controls**: Up Arrow (move forward), Down Arrow (move backward)
- Dodge the cars to reach the finish line.
- Each successful crossing increases the level and car speed.
- Hit a car? Game over!

## How to Run
```bash
cd turtle-crossing-game
python main.py
```
