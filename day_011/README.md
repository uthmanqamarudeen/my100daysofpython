# Day 11: Blackjack Capstone Project

## Objectives
Build a Blackjack game that allows a user to play against the computer.

## House Rules
- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
- Cards: `[11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]`
- Cards have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.

## My Learnings
- **The Value of Breaks**: I struggled with this challenge for hours. Stepping away for a day gave me a fresh perspective that allowed me to solve it immediately upon returning.
- **Recursion Logic**: The main bug I encountered was regarding how I handled recursion. Fixing this logic was the key to completing the project.

## How to Run
```bash
python blackjack.py
```
