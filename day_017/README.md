# Day 17: Quiz Game

## Objectives
- Build a Quiz Game using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Create custom classes (`Question`, `QuizBrain`).
- Use a list of objects to store quiz questions.
- Implement game logic to track score and progress.

## How it Works
- `Question` class stores question text and correct answer.
- `QuizBrain` class manages question flow, user input, and scoring.
- Questions are loaded from `data.py` and converted to `Question` objects.

## How to Run
```bash
cd quiz-game-start
python main.py
```
