# Day 13: Debugging

## Objectives
- Learn finding and fixing errors in Python code.
- Techniques covered:
  - **Describe the Problem**: Untangling logic errors.
  - **Reproduce the Bug**: Identifying the source of random or occasional errors.
  - **Play Computer**: Stepping through code manually.
  - **Fix the Errors**: Syntax vs. Runtime vs. Logical errors.
  - **Print is Your Friend**: Using print statements to trace execution.
  - **Use a Debugger**: Using tools to inspect state.

## Exercises
- **Debbuging Odd/Even**: Fixing logic in modulo check.
- **Debugging Leap Year**: Correcting nested `if/else` logic.
- **Debugging FizzBuzz**: Fixing logical operators (`or` vs `and`) and `if/elif` flow.

## How to Run
```bash
python debugging.py
```
