# Day 9: Secret Auction Project

## Objectives
- Build a Blind Auction program.
- Use **Dictionaries** and **Nesting** to store bidder data.
- Clear the screen between turns (simulated).
- Determine the highest bidder at the end.

## My Learnings
- **Python Dictionaries**: Mastering key-value pairs to store structured data (like bidder names and their bid amounts).
- **Nesting**: Understanding how to store lists inside dictionaries and dictionaries inside lists (crucial for the `travel_log` exercise).
- **Looping through Dictionaries**: Iterating over keys to compare values (used to find the highest bidder).
- **Clearing Output**: Learned how to clear the console to hide previous bids, simulating a "blind" auction.

## How to Run
```bash
python auction/auction.py
```
