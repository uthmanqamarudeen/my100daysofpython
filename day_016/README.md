# Day 16: OOP Coffee Machine

## Objectives
- Rebuild the Coffee Machine using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Master classes and objects in Python.
- Use imported modules/classes (`CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`, `Menu`) to abstract complex logic.
- Understand Attributes and Methods.

## How it Works
- The `Menu` class handles the available drinks.
- The `CoffeeMaker` class manages resources (water, milk, coffee).
- The `MoneyMachine` class handles coins and payments.
- The `main.py` script coordinates these objects to run the machine.

## How to Run
```bash
cd oop-coffee-machine-start
python main.py
```
