# Day 15: Coffee Machine

## Objectives
- Build a fully functional coffee machine simulation.
- Master **Program Requirements**:
  - Print reports of available resources (Water, Milk, Coffee).
  - Check if resources are sufficient.
  - Process coins (Quarter, Dime, Nickle, Penny).
  - Check transaction success.
  - Make coffee and deduct resources.

## How it Works
- The machine starts with a set amount of resources.
- It prompts the user to select a drink (Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino).
- The program checks if there are enough ingredients.
- If sufficient, it asks for coins and calculates the change.
- Finally, it dispenses the drink and updates the resources.

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```
