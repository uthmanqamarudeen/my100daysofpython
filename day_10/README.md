# Day 10: Calculator Project

## Objectives
- Build a text-based calculator.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Use **Recursion** and **While Loops** to allow continuous calculations with the previous answer.
- specific focus on **Functions with Outputs** and **Dictionaries**.

## My Learnings
- **Functions with Outputs**: `return` keyword.
- **Docstrings**: Documenting functions.
- **Recursion**: Calling a function within itself to restart/continue the logic.

## How to Run
```bash
python calculator.py
```
