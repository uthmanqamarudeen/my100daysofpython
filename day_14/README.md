# Day 14: Higher Lower Game

## Objectives
- Build a game comparing Instagram followers of celebrities/brands.
- Integrate **lists of dictionaries** for data handling.
- Master game logic loops, conditional filtering, and re-usability.
- Use imported modules for data and art.

## How it Works
- The game picks two random accounts from `higher_lower_game_data.py`.
- User guesses who has more followers.
- If correct, score increases and the winner becomes the next "Option A".
- Game continues until the user gets it wrong.

## How to Run
```bash
python higher_lower_game.py
```
