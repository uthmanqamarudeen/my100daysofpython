# Day 7: Hangman Project

## Objectives
- Build a Hangman game.
- Use **For & While Loops** to control game flow.
- Handle **If/Else** conditions to check standard user guesses.
- Manipulate **Lists** and **Strings** to display the word blanks.
- Import modules (e.g., `random`) and custom art/word lists.

## My Learnings
- **The Value of Persistence**: This project wasn't straightforward! I went through multiple debugging phases (`debug_hangman.py`, `debug_hangman_2.py`) before arriving at the final solution.
- **Breaking Down Problems**: I learned that when a big logic problem (like the entire game loop) doesn't work, it helps to isolate parts of it into smaller scripts to test them individually.
- **Debug Files**: Keeping my "failed" attempts or debug scripts helped me track my thought process and see where I was going wrong.

## How to Run
```bash
python hangman/hangman_projects.py
```
*(Note: Replace with the main script name if different)*
