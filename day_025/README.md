# Day 25: CSV Data and Pandas

## Objectives
- Learn to handle **Comma Separated Values (CSV)** files.
- Master the **Pandas** library for data analysis.
- Analyze real-world datasets (Squirrel Census, Weather Data).
- creating **US States Game** guessing game.

## Projects

### 1. Squirrel Census Data Analysis
- Analyzed the **2018 Central Park Squirrel Census** data.
- Counted squirrels by fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, Black).
- Generated a new CSV file (`squirrel_count.csv`) with the results.

### 2. U.S. States Game
- A geography quiz game using Turtle and Pandas.
- Type a state name; if correct, it appears on the map.
- Tracks guessed states and generates `states_to_learn.csv` for missing ones (learning tool!).

## How to Run

**Squirrel Analysis:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**US States Game:**
```bash
cd us-states-game-start
python main.py
```
