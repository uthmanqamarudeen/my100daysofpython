# Day 12: Number Guessing Game

## Objectives
- Include an ASCII art logo.
- Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
- Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer.
- If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
- Track the number of turns remaining.
- If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player.
- Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).

## My Learnings
- **Efficient Logic**: I realized that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. While the tutorial used ~50 lines of code, I was able to implement a functional solution in just ~25 lines by simplifying the logic.
- **Independent Problem Solving**: It's important not to limit yourself strictly to the tutor's approach. Exploring different methods can lead to more concise and efficient code.
- **Python Concepts**:
    - Global vs Local Scope
    - Modifying Global Variables
    - Python Constants
    - Loops and Conditionals

## How to Run
```bash
python guess_number.py
```
